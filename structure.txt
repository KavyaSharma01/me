# about

About me

I want to help others make the right decisions, data-driven decisions.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle waiting to be solved. Finding patterns Web Development else sees is the challenge to me. 

With a strong background in data analysis and Data Analytics models, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs. I am experienced in Data Analytics, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, and PowerBI for my data projects.
